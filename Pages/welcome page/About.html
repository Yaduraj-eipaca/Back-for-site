        <h1>How to Use This Site</h1>

        <p>Student can choose a subject in which they have a doubt/question. After choosing a subject they will be given an option to talk to an expert. If they click on the button "Talk to expert" they will be redirected to another 'chat site' where they can ask their question. Expert will be visiting the site from time to time and answer the question of their field. In the present version the site functionality is limited to mathematics. In the later version of the project I will develop functionality for the remaining subjects. Enrolled Experts will also get automatic alert via email as soon as a question is asked in their field and will reply to it. Student will also get a alert when somebody answer their questions. Student will also be able to make video call to experts as per the availability of the experts in the new version.</p>

        <p>If you are signing in as a Expert, Please give answers on the topic in which you think you are highly competent.<br/>
        As a student you are expected to give due respect to the experts, who have volunteered to help you.<br/></p>
